    const key = generateKey()

# Functions

## generateKey

Receive no arguments or **_option_** object with several parameters

### type

Now library can generate two types of codes: **_digit_** (default) and **_string_**.

### length

Only positive integers are supported. The max value for the **_digit_** is 16, for the **_string_** â€“ 32.

### Default options

- **_type_**: "digit" (only digit symbols will be presented)
- **_length_**: 4. For example, 0000

If any of the options parameters won't be presented in options, the default one will be passed.
